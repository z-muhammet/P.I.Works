# Question: Please estimate the number of base stations in Istanbul by explaining how you estimated this number.
## Answer: 

> Istanbul's population exceeding 16 million creates significant density across the city.  Even if we assume that a single base station can typically serve 400 to 500 subscribers, depending on its location and capacity, it can be estimated that there could be around 40,000 to 50,000 base stations.
