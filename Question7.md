# Question: If you were a product manager at WhatsApp, which two new features would you introduce? If you need to prioritize one of them since it is not allowed to develop features in parallel, based on which factors do you make your prioritization? 
### Answer: 

**Converting Voice Messages to Text:** This feature allows users to view the content of voice messages as text without needing to listen to them. By utilizing advanced natural language processing algorithms and multilingual support, the system can accurately transcribe messages, detecting different accents and speech rates. Users can take advantage of this feature by clicking the "Convert to Text" button next to the message, which is particularly useful in quiet environments or when quick information retrieval is needed. This functionality enhances the practicality of communication.

**Self-Destructing Messages:** This feature allows users to send messages that automatically delete after a certain period. When sending a message, users can set a timer to determine how long the message will remain visible. Once the timer expires, the message is permanently deleted from both the sender's and recipient's chat window. This is an ideal solution for sharing temporary information or enhancing privacy, meeting users' needs for control and confidentiality.

Factors such as user needs and urgency, technical feasibility, competitive advantage, and long-term strategic goals can be assessed for prioritization. Based on user feedback and use cases, the most demanded feature and the one that provides the greatest added value should be prioritized.

The feature of converting voice messages to text is crucial in meeting the speed and accessibility expectations of today's users. Many people, especially in work environments or quiet spaces, prefer to quickly read and respond to messages rather than listening to them. This feature saves users time and protects their privacy by keeping messages discreet. Additionally, it offers a significant accessibility advantage for hearing-impaired users, thereby increasing WhatsApp's inclusivity. Overall, this feature significantly enhances user experience and satisfaction.
